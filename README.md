## 💡 Usage

For detailed usage instructions, keyboard shortcuts, and advanced features, see [USAGE.md](./USAGE.md).

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

MindMapper follows a modern architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **Main Process (Electron)**: File operations, window management, application menu
- **Renderer Process (React)**: UI rendering, user interactions, state management
- **IPC Bridge (Preload)**: Secure communication between main and renderer

For detailed architecture documentation, see [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md).

---

## 📊 Data Format

Mind maps are stored in JSON format with the `.mindmap.json` extension. The format supports:

- Hierarchical node structure
- Custom styling per node
- Metadata (creation date, last modified)
- Full state preservation

For the complete data schema, see [DATA_SCHEMA.md](./DATA_SCHEMA.md).
